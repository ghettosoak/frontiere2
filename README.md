# Frontiere v2

Buildsystem unashamedly taken from here: https://github.com/maxomedia/mxm-gulp

Let's rock
1. CD into the _gulp directory
2. run npm install
3. get a coffee, there's a lot to download
4. it'll probably throw an error, ignore and run npm install again
5. done? run gulp
6. boogie

Includes:
- Most of bootstrap, because bower is for suckers
- A handy dandy JS lib with functions I find myself using a lot
- More empty folders than you can shake a stick at
